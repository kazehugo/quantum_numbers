## Element Identifier

**Purpose:**

This Python script identifies the element based on its four quantum numbers: principal quantum number (n), azimuthal quantum number (l), magnetic quantum number (ml), and spin quantum number (ms).

**Usage:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/element-identifier](https://github.com/your-username/element-identifier)


2. **Install dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the script:**
python element_identifier.py

4. **Enter quantum numbers:**
The script will prompt you to enter the four quantum numbers.

Example:

Enter the principal quantum number (n): 2
Enter the azimuthal quantum number (l): 1
Enter the magnetic quantum number (ml): 0
Enter the spin quantum number (ms): 1/2
Output: The element corresponding to the given quantum numbers is: Oxygen

**How it works:**
Validates input: Ensures that the entered quantum numbers are within the allowed ranges.
Calculates atomic number: Determines the atomic number based on the quantum numbers.
Looks up element: Searches for the element name in the pre-defined database using the calculated atomic number.
Displays result: Prints the identified element or an error message if the quantum numbers are invalid.
Database: The script uses a database of elements that maps atomic numbers to their corresponding names. This database is included in the elements.py file.

**Notes:**
Database scope: The database currently includes elements up to atomic number 100.
Database extension: For more elements, you can extend the database in the elements.py file.
Quantum number validation: Ensure that the entered quantum numbers adhere to quantum mechanics rules.
